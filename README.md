# Movie Recommender System

## Overview

This project demonstrates how a content based recommender system works. The main principle used in this recommender system is a term known as "cosine similarity". 

Cosine similary is a method of calculating the similarity between 2 vectors.

## Workflow:
 - Input features are converted into vectors.
 - The cosine similarity is calculated of one input vector with the rest of the features.
 - 5 of the most similar features are then selected and the movie is recommended based on that selection.
